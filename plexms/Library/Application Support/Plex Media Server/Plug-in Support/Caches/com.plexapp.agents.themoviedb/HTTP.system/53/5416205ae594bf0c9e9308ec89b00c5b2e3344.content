Tensions are rising in New Port City as demonstrations are held concerning the interests of foreign cartels. This leads to a shooting incident involving riot police. It all started with a cyberbrain infection released by the terrorist \"Fire Starter.\" An independent offensive unit led by Makoto Kusanagi entrusts the suppression of the situation to their ghosts and aims for their own justice. Below the surface of the incident, lies the \"tin girl\" Emma and the \"scarecrow man\" Burinda Junior. As Kusanagi deals with the incident, she draws near to what those two ghosts were seeking.","popularity":3.578663,"poster_path":"/zWjp86tNqSCIdpvsrGahdxf8Dnz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":528,"logo_path":"/fO3Aof3lXQclYpBByYC8aneTXwA.png","name":"Bandai Visual","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":882,"logo_path":"/fRSWWjquvzcHjACbtF53utZFIll.png","name":"Toho Company, Ltd.","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":6999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kodansha","origin_country":""},{"id":529,"logo_path":"/rwB6w2aPENQbx756pBWSw44Ouk.png","name":"Production I.G","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost in the Shell Arise - Border 4: Ghost Stands Alone","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":44,"releases":{"countries":[{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"JP","primary":false,"release_date":"2014-09-06"},{"certification":"16","iso_3166_1":"DE","primary":false,"release_date":"2017-05-26"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"Motoko Kusanagi","credit_id":"58fb97af925141642f010efc","gender":1,"id":9711,"name":"Maaya Sakamoto","order":1,"profile_path":"/4f8l14Q9XjkG2YTKxZC5egDphv6.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Daisuke Aramaki","credit_id":"58fb97d0925141643c010da0","gender":0,"id":1264225,"name":"Ikkyuu Juku","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Batou","credit_id":"58fb97dfc3a3687a250105c9","gender":0,"id":1264226,"name":"Kenichirou Matsuda","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied","credit_id":"58fb97f6c3a368798401137f","gender":0,"id":124478,"name":"Aya Hisakawa","order":4,"profile_path":"/i7vmhm4U8V0RwJfN6LYHqWaScPV.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Borma","credit_id":"58fb980792514163f5010f6b","gender":2,"id":84507,"name":"Kazuya Nakai","order":5,"profile_path":"/hh4yhrzkDbf3HftDrFoV52SaVil.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Ishikawa","credit_id":"58fb9818925141642f010f67","gender":0,"id":1222051,"name":"Shunsuke Sakuya","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Kurutsu","credit_id":"58fb9825925141640b010e12","gender":0,"id":215271,"name":"Mayumi Asano","order":7,"profile_path":"/b0mgemI8wiUeiXPoseLVuXx9EPM.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Logicoma","credit_id":"58fb983292514163f5010f9e","gender":1,"id":186341,"name":"Miyuki Sawashiro","order":8,"profile_path":"/uXnEBFwtq2Un0ripVQIBSscDzjp.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Pazu","credit_id":"58fb984e92514163f5010fb7","gender":2,"id":1264228,"name":"Youji Ueda","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Raizo","credit_id":"58fb986e9251416428010c1e","gender":0,"id":1247770,"name":"Takanori Hoshino","order":10,"profile_path":"/lihUbhfA5AqPKMnqoc2Guwc0rLw.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Saito","credit_id":"58fb988a925141643c010e73","gender":2,"id":1264227,"name":"Takurou Nakakuni","order":11,"profile_path":"/kKRsggmiO3cvEJaZl7Zy4mxrXGc.jpg"},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Togusa","credit_id":"58fb98a492514163ec010b81","gender":0,"id":1246422,"name":"Tarusuke Shingaki","order":12,"profile_path":"/jc1rik0c3QyKzVlzK77HCDxlFbU.jpg"},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Emma Tsuda","credit_id":"58fb98c9c3a368798401147d","gender":1,"id":1254671,"name":"Kayano Ai","order":13,"profile_path":"/gF7FH1XYb5hIOBiVHF7Bw1e4UF4.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"53b056020e0a265980006754","department":"Writing","gender":2,"id":57303,"job":"Novel","name":"Masamune Shirow","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53b056880e0a2659790066c7","department":"Directing","gender":2,"id":571455,"job":"Director","name":"Susumu Kudou","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57d12a1d9251417fa7005741","department":"Directing","gender":0,"id":16142,"job":"Director","name":"Kazuchika Kise","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5929d7d99251413b5b0528c6","department":"Art","gender":0,"id":1824736,"job":"Art Direction","name":"Takamasa Mashiki","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5929d7f9c3a368787004b805","department":"Sound","gender":0,"id":1316821,"job":"Music","name":"Keigo Oyamada","profile_path":null}]}}
