With such a busy schedule she and her husband, town sheriff Jake Russell (Chris Potter), aren’t getting much sleep. Hoping for a break, Cassie plans a much needed vacation with her new family. But things go awry when a crime wave sweeps through town and an investigative reporter (Geordie Johnson) tries to ruin Cassie’s image after a video of her magically disappearing turns up on the internet.  To make matters worse, Cassie’s estranged foster mother (Janet-Laine Green) appears in town and Cassie’s stepdaughter (Hannah Endicott-Douglas) is suddenly accused of the recent robberies. Supported by her loyal family and friends, Cassie must rely on her signature charm to put a stop to the rumors before they completely destroy the town, and a Good Witch’s reputation!","popularity":1.777,"poster_path":"/oxmyhkG2Dw18AXntNX4CpDhfsqB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17457,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whizbang Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Good Witch has her hands full juggling her new job as mayor while trying to spend quality time with her family.","title":"The Good Witch's Charm","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":26,"releases":{"countries":[{"certification":"0","iso_3166_1":"DE","primary":false,"release_date":"2015-05-29"},{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"US","primary":false,"release_date":"2012-10-27"},{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"FR","primary":false,"release_date":"2013-06-03"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":4,"character":"Cassandra Nightingale","credit_id":"52fe4bd09251416c7510ed1b","gender":1,"id":4493,"name":"Catherine Bell","order":0,"profile_path":"/7fLeVjQMTGbsbd0WfgaZSZ4wan2.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Tara","credit_id":"52fe4bd09251416c7510ed1f","gender":1,"id":168790,"name":"Ashley Leggat","order":1,"profile_path":"/vbVtaze6B9HDSm9FCV9oPWyxhOE.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Jake Russell","credit_id":"52fe4bd09251416c7510ed23","gender":2,"id":72997,"name":"Chris Potter","order":2,"profile_path":"/e4CkThnHZ4ttXJwNBEAhsQLx6RH.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Brandon Russell","credit_id":"52fe4bd09251416c7510ed27","gender":2,"id":20377,"name":"Matthew Knight","order":3,"profile_path":"/wjqrNj5vSvqsgMKuIy30SCDguyJ.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"5a15c01ac3a3683098002557","gender":2,"id":569794,"name":"Nathan McLeod","order":4,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4bd09251416c7510ed0b","department":"Directing","gender":2,"id":145210,"job":"Director","name":"Craig Pryce","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4bd09251416c7510ed11","department":"Writing","gender":0,"id":25737,"job":"Writer","name":"G.
