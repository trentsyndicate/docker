But the five million migrant workers who live there and make up more than half the population have an entirely different experience. They live in appalling conditions, and regularly end up with nothing, even after years of hard work. Now, as correspondent Ben Anderson investigates, many of them are employed on a project bearing the name of a man who might be the next president.\r\n\r\n'China in Africa' - China is financing more infrastructure projects and selling more goods to Africa than any other trade partner in the world, with a large share of investments linked to the extraction of resources. Correspondent Isobel Yeung heads to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and South Africa to meet the characters behind the business deals and explore what this increasingly prominent relationship could mean for the future of global politics.","language":{"episodeName":"en","overview":"en"},"productionCode":"","showUrl":"","lastUpdated":1515396834,"dvdDiscid":"","dvdSeason":null,"dvdEpisodeNumber":null,"dvdChapter":null,"absoluteNumber":46,"filename":"episodes/264739/5542231.jpg","seriesId":264739,"lastUpdatedBy":402083,"airsAfterSeason":null,"airsBeforeSeason":null,"airsBeforeEpisode":null,"thumbAuthor":402083,"thumbAdded":"2018-01-07 23:24:53","thumbWidth":"400","thumbHeight":"225","imdbId":"tt5663086","siteRating":0,"siteRatingCount":0}}
