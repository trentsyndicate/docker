In 2009, a convoy of 57 of Governor Esmael Mangudadatu's supporters, friends and family were ambushed and killed as they drove to file his papers to run for office. Correspondent Ryan Duffy rides with the governor-and his heavily armed convoy-as he attempts to file his papers to run again. Duffy explores the gun crazy attitudes prevalent in the Philippines, where some areas boast a 70 percent gun ownership rate, and visits with underground gun makers and a terrorist training camp, which consists almost entirely of children.\r\n\r\n'The Killer Kids of the Taliban' - In Afghanistan, the Taliban has ramped up its use of children in suicide bombing terrorist attacks. Ranging from teenagers to children as young as six years old, they are routinely manipulated and lied to as they are sent to blow up their targets. VICE co-founder Shane Smith travels to Kabul to speak with children who have been arrested before detonating themselves. He finds they're often ignorant of the actual teachings of the Koran, but have been misled by terror-preaching imams. In a visit with a high-ranking Taliban official, the former commander is cagey when asked about the subject of suicide bombing, but feels its use is justified in a time of war. When Smith visits the family of victims of one of the worst attacks in Kabul's history, they demand to know why."},{"absoluteNumber":11,"airedEpisodeNumber":1,"airedSeason":2,"airedSeasonID":572786,"dvdEpisodeNumber":null,"dvdSeason":null,"episodeName":"The Afghan Money Pit \u0026 The Pacification of Rio","firstAired":"2014-03-14","id":4765085,"language":{"episodeName":"en","overview":"en"},"lastUpdated":1492694117,"overview":"'The Afghan Money Pit' - The U.S. has spent nearly $100 billion on reconstruction projects in Afghanistan, the most spent on any country in history. But John Sopko, special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, has found that much of that money has been wasted and misused, and has even fallen into the hands of the Taliban. Shane Smith heads to Afghanistan for a tour of American taxpayer dollars gone down the drain.\r\n\r\n'The Pacification of Rio' - Rio de Janeiro is working hard to remedy its reputation as a drug and murder capital in time for the upcoming World Cup and Olympics. The Special Police Operations Battalion (BOPE) has been charged with pacifying the slums (favelas), but BOPE's military occupation of increasing numbers of favelas has been criticized as heavy-handed. Some corrupt members of the BOPE, together with ex-police, have formed militia gangs of their own and are controlling many favelas by sinister means, openly extorting, torturing, killing and making criminals disappear. Still, there are hundreds of favelas, untouched by pacification, that remain under the control of drug gangs who act with complete impunity. Ben Anderson looks behind the picturesque façade of Rio's marketing campaign to reveal the dark underbelly of the city.
