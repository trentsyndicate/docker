Now, Saudi Arabia–nervous about the insurrection near its southern border–is trying to push the Houthis back with a ruthless bombing campaign. Ben Anderson returns to Yemen, where he reported ‘The Enemy of My Enemy’ for VICE S2, to witness one of the worlds most bloody and underreported conflicts. \r\n\r\n‘Church and States’ - While many Americans cheered the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, the fight for equality is far from over. In many American states, it is still legally acceptable to refuse services, housing or employment to people because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Gianna Toboni meets some of the families who are navigating this new landscape, and hears from supporters of religious freedom laws, as VICE explores where the battle for equal rights heads from here.","language":{"episodeName":"en","overview":"en"},"productionCode":"","showUrl":"","lastUpdated":1515396810,"dvdDiscid":"","dvdSeason":null,"dvdEpisodeNumber":null,"dvdChapter":null,"absoluteNumber":42,"filename":"episodes/264739/5504065.jpg","seriesId":264739,"lastUpdatedBy":402083,"airsAfterSeason":null,"airsBeforeSeason":null,"airsBeforeEpisode":null,"thumbAuthor":402083,"thumbAdded":"2018-01-07 23:24:29","thumbWidth":"400","thumbHeight":"225","imdbId":"tt5541606","siteRating":8,"siteRatingCount":1}}
