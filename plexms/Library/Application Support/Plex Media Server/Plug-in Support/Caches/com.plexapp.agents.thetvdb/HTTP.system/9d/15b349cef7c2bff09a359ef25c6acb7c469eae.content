They're the same age and have the same interests, so they quickly become close. Little does Kaneki know that Rize is a ghoul - a kind of monster that lives by hunting and devouring human flesh. When part of her special organ - \"the red child\" - is transplanted into Kaneki, he becomes a ghoul himself, trapped in a warped world where humans are not the top of the food chain.","origin_country":["JP"],"popularity":19.307653}],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}
