But in Pakistan's poorest areas, there is widespread distrust of vaccinators, and the Pakistani Taliban have openly condoned violence against them -- especially after the CIA used a vaccinator to help track down Osama Bin Laden. VICE travels to Karachi to meet with the health workers putting their lives on the line to finally eradicate this disease.\r\n\r\n'Collateral Damage' - Land mines are deadly weapons of war that remain a threat for years after the fighting is over. But even as international pressure has helped limit the use of land mines, unexploded cluster munitions are still in use, killing and maiming civilians every day. VICE travels to Myanmar and Laos to see the devastating effects of unexploded ordnance and to meet the trained disposal teams working to clean up these weapons before they claim more lives.","language":{"episodeName":"en","overview":"en"},"productionCode":"","showUrl":"","lastUpdated":1515396846,"dvdDiscid":"","dvdSeason":null,"dvdEpisodeNumber":null,"dvdChapter":null,"absoluteNumber":48,"filename":"episodes/264739/5549352.jpg","seriesId":264739,"lastUpdatedBy":402083,"airsAfterSeason":null,"airsBeforeSeason":null,"airsBeforeEpisode":null,"thumbAuthor":402083,"thumbAdded":"2018-01-07 23:25:05","thumbWidth":"400","thumbHeight":"225","imdbId":"tt5687796","siteRating":0,"siteRatingCount":0}}
