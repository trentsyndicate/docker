Massive factory farms are springing up to supply that demand. But industrial meat operations produce more than just cheap T-bones; they also dish out enormous environmental harm. Isobel Yeung travels to the feedlots, farms and slaughterhouses where our meat is made, to see the true costs of our burger habit. \r\n\r\n'End of Water' - Water is the single most vital resource we have--but it's also one of the most threatened. Around the world, from the American West to China, South Asia, and the Middle East, the water we need is simply disappearing. Vikram Gandhi reports from California's once-abundant farmland and the heart of Sao Paulo's reservoir system to assess the depths of the crisis, and what can be done to reverse it.","language":{"episodeName":"en","overview":"en"},"productionCode":"","showUrl":"","lastUpdated":1515396805,"dvdDiscid":"","dvdSeason":null,"dvdEpisodeNumber":null,"dvdChapter":null,"absoluteNumber":41,"filename":"episodes/264739/5488418.jpg","seriesId":264739,"lastUpdatedBy":402083,"airsAfterSeason":null,"airsBeforeSeason":null,"airsBeforeEpisode":null,"thumbAuthor":402083,"thumbAdded":"2018-01-07 23:24:24","thumbWidth":"400","thumbHeight":"225","imdbId":"tt5504620","siteRating":8,"siteRatingCount":1}}
