  <summary>With all guests now gathered, except for Son Goku and Vegeta, Bulma's birthday party gets underway. Trunks shows Son Goten where his mother hid the bingo tournament grand prize – the Dragon Balls. Not far off from the ship, Pilaf's Gang, now poor and hungry, are trying to get by until they find the Dragon Balls and make their wishes come true. When his Dragon Radar picks up a signal coming from Bulma's ship, Pilaf and his henchmen hastily board the ship, with Trunks and Goten's help. Meanwhile, on Kaiō-sama's planet, Kaiō-sama explains to Goku who and what exactly Beerus is and that for every benevolent God there must be a malevolent one, in order to keep the Universe in balance. Just as he finishes, Beerus and Whis arrive. </summary>
