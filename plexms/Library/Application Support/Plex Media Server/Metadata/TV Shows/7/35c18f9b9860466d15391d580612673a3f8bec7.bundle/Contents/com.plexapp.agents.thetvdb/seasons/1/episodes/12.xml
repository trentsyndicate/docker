  <summary>Goku and Beerus continue to fight in space. As both of them power up and clash, the universe begins to crumble under the power of the gods. Celestial bodies get crushed due to the shockwaves. Meanwhile Old Kaiō-sama reveals to Supreme Kaiō-sama that with three more blows the whole universe would be destroyed along with Beerus and Goku. Goku, on landing the third clash with Beerus, unknowingly saves the universe's collapse by balancing Beerus's attack with his own. Beerus gets enraged and uses his Atomic bomb attack on Goku. Goku uses the Super Saiyan God power to power up his Kamehameha to keep Beerus's attack at bay. &#13;
