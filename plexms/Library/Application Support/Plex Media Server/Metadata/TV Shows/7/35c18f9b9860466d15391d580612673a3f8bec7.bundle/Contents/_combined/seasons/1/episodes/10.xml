  <summary>Now a Super Saiyan God, Goku confronts Beerus. He is amazed by the immense power his body has gained with the transformation, so much so that he is initially unable to fully grasp its newfound potential. Fighting with Beerus, Goku manages to grow gradually into his new form. Seeing as how Goku might turn out to be a worthy adversary after all, Beerus decides it is time for them to unleash their true power and have a real battle of Gods. &#13;
