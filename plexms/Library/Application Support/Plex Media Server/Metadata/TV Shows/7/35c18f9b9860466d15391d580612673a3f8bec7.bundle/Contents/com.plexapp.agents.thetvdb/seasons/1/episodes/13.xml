  <summary>The Kai≈ç-shin are surprised that the Universe is still intact following the battle, but they fear the worst is still to come. On Earth, Vegeta, Whis, and the others are still standing by, watching the battle. Whis is surprised by the Super Saiyan God's power and its ability to keep up with his trainee. In space, Goku struggles to keep up with Beerus' attack, which ultimately ends up in a massive explosion, blinding everyone on Earth. Shortly after, the light clears out, revealing everything to be as it was prior to the explosion. Beerus explains that he used his full power to negate the explosion, thereby saving the Universe. Seeing it as a perfect opportunity to boast, Mr. Satan arranges to have him be falsely credited with saving the planet yet again. Despite being at his limit, Goku remains calm, which annoys the God of Destruction. Beerus thinks Goku might have a strategy that he has been hiding which Goku promptly denies, saying that everything he had been doing was improvised as they fought. The Gods quickly power up and continue fighting, but this time, both at their limit. However, as soon as they start, Goku loses his Super Saiyan God aura, reverting to the ordinary Super Saiyan form. Upon noticing that, Beerus decides to quit, thinking it is pointless to fight an ordinary Saiyan. Goku, however, does not notice and keeps going at it. Able to sense Goku's energy, Whis assumes that the battle has concluded and that Goku lost, but Piccolo begs to differ. Surprised that Goku is still able to hit him even after losing his God form, Beerus surmises that Goku's body has adjusted to the Super Saiyan God power, making him stronger in his ordinary form. Goku proclaims that, with or without the Super Saiyan God form, it is still him that Beerus is up against, and the two resume their battle. </summary>
