  <summary>When a terminally ill ex-con is linked to a bank heist, Art and Raylan must find him before he and his young henchmen can strike again. However, the manhunt is complicated when Winona worries that a hundred-dollar bill she took from an evidence room locker will be traced back to her after it is taken in the robbery.</summary>
