  <summary>The army sent by the Empire to deal with the Japanese forces stationed at Alnus Hill where the Gate is located is obliterated. Emperor Molt calls for the vassal states to attack them, just to be defeated with huge casualties as well, a move planned in advance by the emperor to avoid the vassal states taking advantage of the Empire's weakened state. As Emperor Molt decides to delay a possible advance from the JSDF with a scorched earth maneuver, the President of the United States decides to leave the investigation of the Special Region to the JSDF for a while, and Itami is assigned to lead the 3rd Recon Unit, created to survey the nearby cities and points of interest. After passing by the village of Coda, the 3rd Unit finds a massive Fire Dragon burning the nearby forest and then attacking and destroying a nearby settlement. While looking for survivors, Itami finds an unconscious elf woman inside a well.</summary>
