  <summary>The JSDF sends a helicopter unit to assist the 3rd Unit to defend Italica, defeating the invaders with extreme prejudice, much to Pi単a's astonishment, as the military weaponry and tech displayed by the Japanese soldiers lies beyond anything she had seen before. After Lelei sells the scales and Itami establishes some rather favorable conditions for Pi単a and the Italicans in exchange for their sovereignty, the 3rd Unit departs back to Alnus Hill, only to encounter Pi単a's Order of the Rose Knights on their way. Upon knowing their identities, the knights capture Itami, unaware of the peace treaty he and Pi単a established. In order to avoid escalated conflict, Itami orders his unit to return without him instead of fighting. </summary>
