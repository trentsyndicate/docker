  <summary>Itami's party arrives at Italica, just as the city's forces, led by Princess Piña has just repelled a siege from an invading bandit force. Knowing that her knights combined with the local soldiers have not enough strength to keep holding off the bandits until help arrives, Piña finds herself in a predicament until meeting the 3rd Recon Unit. Upon being informed of the situation, Itami decides to help defend the city and agrees with her plan of positioning himself and his soldiers in the least guarded side of the walls, in order to act as a decoy. However, the enemy does not fall for their trap and launch an attack on the main force instead. As the city's defenses are broken, Itami wonders about what will be the princess' next step as she sees herself on the verge of despair. </summary>
