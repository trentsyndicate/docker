  <summary>Pi単a scolds her knights Bozes and Panache for not only attacking Itami but treating him inhumanely, which both violated the treaty she signed with him which she fears the JSDF will use as an excuse to attack them. As the Formal family staff treat Itami wounds, Rory, Lelei, Tuka and some of the 3rd Unit sneak back to Italica to rescue Itami but not before learning, much to Shino Kuribayashi shock, Itami is a Special Forces Ranger. The 3rd Unit are welcomed by the Formal maids and join Itami for a small party where some of the soldiers get to know the non-human maids. Meanwhile, Pi単a orders Bozes to sleep with Itami as an apology but gets angry and slaps him after seeing him having a party. Wishing to apologize to Itami's superiors personally for Bozes actions, she and Bozes join the 3rd Unit's trip back to Alnus Hill where they witness the JSDF having a Field training exercise along with tanks and helicopters, and is shock to learn from Lelei that their their soldiers do not use magic but weapons called guns. While Pi単a and Bozes meets with Itami's commanding officer Lieutenant General Hazama with Lelei as an interpreter, Itami invites Tuka to come with him to Japan to meet the Japanese Diet as a representative of the Special Region. The next day, Itami, Shino and Akira Tomita accompany Rory, Lelei, Tuka to Japan using the Gate along with Pi単a and Bozes to show them around.</summary>
