  <summary>Meet Craig, a proud Alaskan living in the woods of Fairbanks, fearing the collapse of the American economy. He's secretly built a bug-out dome, designed by friend and prepping partner Don. Accessible only by boat, the dome will serve as a refuge for his wife and two daughters. Then we follow David, a new age spiritual prepper from Hawaii, who fears a catastrophic tsunami will strike the island but has prepped with his girlfriend to bug out to the top of a mountain. </summary>
