  <summary>Think you've got what it takes to survive the end of days? NGC will study the full spectrum of prepper types, from lone wolves to full-fledged neighborhood networks. We'll look at a variety of our best preppers from season 2 to see how their prepping styles differ. Join us as we learn about bunker stew, bunker living and prepping as a team. Doomsday preppers come in all shapes and sizes. From freshly initiated spouses to ex-military types to grumpy kids, there's a prepper to be found anywhere.</summary>
