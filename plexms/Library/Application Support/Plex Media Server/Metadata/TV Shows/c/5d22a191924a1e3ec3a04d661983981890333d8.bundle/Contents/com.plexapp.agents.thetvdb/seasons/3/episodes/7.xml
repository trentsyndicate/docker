  <summary>While many preppers believe defense is the best strategy for surviving a Doomsday scenario, one family in Tacoma, Wash., is banking on a good offense. Tyler, his wife and his cousin have assembled a group of like-minded, would-be marauders from their neighborhood in preparation for a catastrophic domestic terrorist attack. They have only six months' worth of food because they plan on taking what they need in order to survive Â— and to stay safe, they're developing the ultimate suit of armor.</summary>
