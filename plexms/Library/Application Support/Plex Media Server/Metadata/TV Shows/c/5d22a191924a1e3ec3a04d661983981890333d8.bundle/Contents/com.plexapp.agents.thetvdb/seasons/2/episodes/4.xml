  <summary>A single dirty bomb could cause massive chaos. Tom Perez is prepping for a terrorist attack and suspects it's only a matter of time before one gets through our defenses. He has not worked in 12 years because he spends most of his day prepping and spends much of his family's yearly income on preps.</summary>
