  <summary>Meet the Coy family, who live in the shadow of Mount St. Helens and prep for its eruption. Each member of the family has a specific job and multiple means of escape, including over land and water. Another prepper, Capt. William E. Simpson, has spent six years singlehandedly building his perfect bunker, but it's not underground: it's his sailboat.</summary>
