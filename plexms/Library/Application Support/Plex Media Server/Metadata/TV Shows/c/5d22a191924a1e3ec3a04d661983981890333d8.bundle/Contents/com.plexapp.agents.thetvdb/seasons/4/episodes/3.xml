  <summary>Roger Dougan lost his home in a fire seven years ago. He's working to become self-sufficient through prepping, so he never has to feel helpless again. Before the 2000 New Year, Curtis bought a generator and stocked up on food and water, but it occurred to him that if something serious did happen, he wasn't nearly as prepared as he should be Â— so he became a prepper. Karissa Baca lost her job during the 2008 financial crisis, causing her to realize how fragile the economy is and begin prepping.</summary>
