  <summary>Prepping for an economic collapse, Jeff is converting a decommissioned missile silo into the perfect bug-out getaway. But that's not all Jeff is focused on. With an online dating profile, he is also searching for a special someone who can share his love for prepping. We'll see Jeff, a bachelor on the lookout for love, not only work on his bunker, but also go on multiple dates to find his prepper mate. We also meet Doug, who lives in the mountains of Tennesse and is known by locals as "Rockman". </summary>
