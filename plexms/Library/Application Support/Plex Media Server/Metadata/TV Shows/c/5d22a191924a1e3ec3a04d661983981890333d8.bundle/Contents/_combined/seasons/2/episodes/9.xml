  <summary>Businessman by day, prepper by night. Brent lives in fear of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that will make the world go dark, leaving his family of 12 with nothing. To prep for life after the EMP, Brent has constructed a medieval-style castle that will serve as the ultimate bug-out fortress. Derek runs a Wild West theme park and fears that a solar flare will hit earth's atmosphere. He and his family use their amusement park as a secret prepping oasis, where they can practice strategic defense.</summary>
