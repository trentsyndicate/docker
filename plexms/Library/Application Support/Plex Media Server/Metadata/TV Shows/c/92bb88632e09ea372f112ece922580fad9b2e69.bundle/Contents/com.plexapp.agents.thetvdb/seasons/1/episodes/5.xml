  <summary>After spending a night in Las Vegas, Charlie decides to live up to his promise that he made to Jake about attending his soccer game.  During the game, Charlie sets up a play-date with an unattached mother named Kate, and they hit it off.  During one of their dates, Charlie seems like he's ready for a serious relation.    Alan sets up a meeting with Gloria (one of the soccer moms) to write a soccer newsletter, but Gloria has other intentions for the evening, and he has no idea.  During the evening another soccer mom, Brooke, tries to move in on Gloria's plans.</summary>
