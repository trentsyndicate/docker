  <summary>Dean sees an obituary notice for a wrestler he and Sam used to watch when they were kids. Deciding they need a break from tracking the Darkness, the brothers decide to attend the funeral to pay their respects. The funeral is full of wrestlers, including Shawn Harley, a hot shot new wrestler with a fiery temper who pushes everyoneâ€™s buttons, and veteran wrestler Gunner Lawless. Sam and Dean attend the next match to re-live one of their fondest childhood memories but when another wrestler turns up dead, play time quickly turns to work.</summary>
