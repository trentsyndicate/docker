  <summary>Minori suggests that their group hold off on entering the dungeon until that afternoon much to the protest of Rundelhaus, and instead has them each explain their respective skills. In doing so, the group discover that their teamwork lacked cohesion. After Minori explains the basics of party combat as taught to her by Shiroe, the group enters the dungeon the next day. Armed with their new knowledge, each person assumes a clearly defined role in the party and they finally overcome the battles they were forced to retreat from previously. Back at the Palace of Eternal Ice, Shiroe starts documenting all the information he learnt from Regan and lies to Henrietta to keep her from discovering them. While pondering on what to do next, Shiroe receives a call from Minori where she gives him the progress of their training and thrilling him with the fact that Minori's group finally realized the importance of teamwork and friendship. The next day, Crusty continues to meet with Lenessia while Minori, Serara and Isuzu discuss the latter's compatibility with Rundelhaus. However that night, as Rundelhaus and Isuzu have another exchange, the latter discovers that the system strangely prevents her from adding Rundelhaus to her friend list. The next day, the training camp at the beach find themselves in a sudden attack by a massive army of Sahuagin monsters. </summary>
