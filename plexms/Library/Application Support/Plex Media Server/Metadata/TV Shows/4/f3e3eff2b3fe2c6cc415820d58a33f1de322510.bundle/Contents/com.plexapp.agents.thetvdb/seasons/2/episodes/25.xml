  <summary>The Shibuya raiding party begins another assault on the Calling Fortress and manage to break through to the roof where they encounter the raid boss: Taliktan, the Genius of Summoning. After failing to establish communication with the monster, it summons swarms of moths which engulf Shibuya and the other player cities. This puts a severe strain on the antenna and Shiroe has the party take the battle into the concert hall below. Despite inflicting a great amount of damage to Taliktan, they are still pummeled by its powerful field attacks. However Shiroe's Full-Control Encounter raises the stakes and gives the party a significant advantage in pushing Taliktan to the edge and ultimately their victory. In the aftermath, Regan sets up the radio equipment and much everyone's surprise, Shiroe makes contact with Kanami in the Chinese server. She then tasks him with seeking a way to allow transit between the real and Elder Tale worlds and relieves the Shibuya party about Krusty's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Nureha and Plant Hwyaden decide to establish relations with Eastal and the Round Table to combat the common Genius threat. Finally, Log Horizon makes plans to celebrate their victory and with the dawn over the horizon, Shiroe and Akatsuki praise each other.&#13;
In the epilogue, Log Horizon holds a victory party and Regan skips out on his task with repairing the radio equipment to join the festivities. </summary>
