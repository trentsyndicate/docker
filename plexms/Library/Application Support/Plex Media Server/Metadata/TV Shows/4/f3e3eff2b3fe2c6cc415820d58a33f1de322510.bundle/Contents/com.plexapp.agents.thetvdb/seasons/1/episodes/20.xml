  <summary>Shiroe leaves for Choushi while Minori relays their situation. Using Regan's theories of revival, Shiroe has Minori, Serara and Isuzu alternate between restoring Rundelhaus' health and magic to prevent his body from being destroyed. Meanwhile, Misa and Lenessia update Crusty on the status of the battle and they prepare to intercept the goblin general's forces in Zantleaf. At the same time, Shiroe arrives at Minori and co's location and uses his enchanter abilities and a revival item to restore Roundelhaus' magic and temporarily revive him as a zombie for a few minutes. As Rundelhaus awakens and accepts his fate much to the grief of his friends, Shiroe sharply rebuffs his resolve. Using the theory to bend the laws of the world by making things oneself, Shiroe presents Rundelhaus with a contract to join Log Horizon as an adventurer. Willing to use his abilities for the good of others, Rundelhaus signs the contract and dies as one of the People of the Land. Elsewhere, Crusty and the other adventurers mercilessly slaughter the goblin general and his forces at Zantleaf while Marielle's group and the reinforcements repel the Sahuagin monsters invading Choushi. Afterwards Shiroe explains his definition of an adventurer to Minori. Finally, Rundelhaus awakens at the cathedral to his new status as an adventurer and gets a severe scolding from Isuzu for his recklessness. </summary>
