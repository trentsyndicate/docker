  <summary>Shiroe, accompanied by Crusty and Michitaka arrive at the banquet and easily counters Lord Malves' ruse with one of their own, forcing the latter to make a hasty retreat. Shiroe then excludes himself from the continuing festivities until Minori voices her concern over his actions. However Shiroe reassures her that he accepts appearing as the villain as long as he can accomplish his tasks, something which also Akatsuki berates herself for being blind to. Sometime later, Shiroe goes to meet with the contact he sent to Minami—Ōshima, although a disguised woman calling herself Dariella confronts him instead. Upon seeing through her disguise though, Shiroe forces the leader of Minami's lone guild—Nureha of Plant Hwyaden to reveal herself. Afterwards, each reveals the information they possess on the other's accomplishments, with Nureha also voicing her intention to recruit Shiroe because of a supposed past meeting of theirs. She then explains her knowledge of his research into finding a way back to the real world and bribes him with her resources and his ambivalence towards Akihibara. However Shiroe rejects Nureha's proposal, forcing her to withdraw, still with her goal to have him. Later, the Scale Festival enters its last stages and Log Horizon sits down to dinner and reassures Shiroe of their intention to help him however they can. Faced with new challenges, Shiroe issues Log Horizon their next goal of changing the world of Elder Tale.&#13;
In the epilogue, Shiroe notifies Regan of his intention to leave Akihibara and Regan asks to accompany him. </summary>
