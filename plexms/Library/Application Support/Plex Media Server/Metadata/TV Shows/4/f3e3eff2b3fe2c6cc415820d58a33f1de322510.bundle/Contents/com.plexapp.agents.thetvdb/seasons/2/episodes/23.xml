  <summary>Roderic informs Shiroe that a device to communicate with the Moon would cost an astronomical amount of funds to construct but he isn't sure whether it would actually work or not. Elsewhere Tohya and his party discuss whether or not they want to return to their own reality. Back in Maihama, Lord Sergiatte summons Isaac and explains that he intends to announce Iselus as the next heir to the Cowen throne and asks Isaac to continue to watching over him. Karashin later notes on the growing tensions between Westelande and Eastal. The next day, Maihama hosts a banquet for Prince Iselus and Sergiatte expresses his regret for making him bear the enormous responsibility of ruler. Though, with Isaac's support, Sergiatte presents Iselus as the heir to the throne of Maihama. A group of Westelande Landers then crash the event and attempt to assassinate Prince Iselus, however Isaac protects him with support from Karashin and Reserick. Regan later visits Shiroe to relay his latest findings and also notes that he detected a faint signal from the Shibuya TV station while investigating the transport gates. Suddenly, they receive word of people mysteriously collapsing all over Maihama and Akihabara while a mysterious black cloud showers the city of Akihabara with strange spores. </summary>
