  <summary>While continuing on their way to the District of Susukino, Shiroe, Naotsugu and Akatsuki enter a familiar dungeon known as the Depths of Palm. As Marielle calls to check up on their progress, Shiroe surprises her at the distance they managed to cover in three days. Meanwhile in Susukino, Serara seems to be doing fine in the care of Nyanta—a player using a cat avatar who had saved her from her pursuers. While they wonder about the kind of people Shiroe and co. are, the Dark Guild, Brigandia continue looting and pillaging the district. Back in Akihabara, Marielle begins a meeting with the guild masters of Akihibara, while another mysterious guild master learns of the meeting and of Shiroe's movements. Meanwhile, Shiroe and co. cross an ancient bridge in the dungeon which suddenly starts crumbling and causes Shiroe to plummet into the lake below. As Shiroe recalls his time with the adventuring group, Debauchery Tea Party, he regains consciousness to find himself having been saved by his comrades. Eventually Shiroe and co. find themselves face to face with the dungeon's boss, a Novasphere Pioneers' creature called the Rat-maso and quickly engage and defeat it battle. Afterwards, they finally arrive at the dungeon's exit and are rewarded with a spectacular view of the sunset over the channel. Elsewhere, the guild master of Brigandia—Demikas, issues a manhunt for Serara and Nyanta. </summary>
