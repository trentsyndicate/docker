  <summary>After another lackluster Father’s Day overshadowed by graduation parties and summer vacations, Dre and his colleagues decide to come up with a holiday initiative entitled “Daddy’s Day,” celebrating everything that Father’s Day is not. When Dre meets Resheida, a friend of Zoey’s who doesn’t have a Dad, they develop a bond after he is snubbed by Zoey and she backs him up on the fact that Dads should be respected and heralded. Meanwhile, Junior decides to help Bow around the house but ends up becoming more of a hassle than a help.</summary>
