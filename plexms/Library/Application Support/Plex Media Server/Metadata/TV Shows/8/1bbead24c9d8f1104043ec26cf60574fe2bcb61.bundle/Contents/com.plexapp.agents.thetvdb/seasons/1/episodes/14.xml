  <summary>When Zoey brings home her first "serious" boyfriend, a boy from school also named Andre, Dre takes an instant dislike to him for many reasons, including the fact that he's white, from France and rather worldly for a kid. He's thrilled when they break up...until he learns that Andre dumped Zoey because she's too shallow, something Dre takes as a personal affront.</summary>
