  <summary>In the Johnson home, Sundays involve SAT prep and sports, so when the family is invited to Church on Sunday by the neighbors, Dre goes against his instinct of always saying "no" and agrees. When they end up having one of the best Sundays they can remember, they realize they should say "yes" to things more often. Meanwhile, Jack and Diane find out they were never baptized, and take it upon themselves to do whatever they want.&#13;
