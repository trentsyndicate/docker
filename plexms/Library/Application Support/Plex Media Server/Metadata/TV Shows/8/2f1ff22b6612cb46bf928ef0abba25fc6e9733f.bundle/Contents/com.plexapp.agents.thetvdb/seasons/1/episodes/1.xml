  <summary>Special Agent Dana Scully is partnered with Special Agent Fox Mulder to validate his work on a special project called the X-Files. While he is a believer in the paranormal fueled by a lost memory of his sister's abduction, she is a scientist and prefers to look for rational, logical explanations. Their first case takes them to Oregon to investigate the unsolved murders of several High School classmates who "Spooky" Mulder believes have been experimented on by aliens.</summary>
