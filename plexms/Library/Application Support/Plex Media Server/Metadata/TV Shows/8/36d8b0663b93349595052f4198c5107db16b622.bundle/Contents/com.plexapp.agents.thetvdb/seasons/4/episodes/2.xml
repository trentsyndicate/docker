  <summary>‘Escape to Europe’ - With the war in Syria now in its fifth bloody year, half the country's population has been displaced, and four million have fled. Many are heading to the safety and relative prosperity of Europe, but getting there is a long, life-threatening journey. VICE follows the refugee trail from the Syrian border to Europe, meeting Syrians determined to find a better life.&#13;
&#13;
‘Cycle of Terror’ - The bloody ISIS attacks in Paris stunned the world. As rumors circulated that one of the attackers may have posed as a Syrian migrant, politicians in Western countries, including the U.S., raced to declare their territory off-limits to refugees from countries like Syria and Iraq. VICE travels to France and around the U.S. to see how the global reaction to the violence in Paris is affecting the fight against terrorism.</summary>
