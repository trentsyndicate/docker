  <summary>'Palestine Now' - The conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people has been locked in a cycle of violence for generations. But now, young people in the West Bank are growing so disillusioned with the status quo that they're turning their backs on their own government. VICE reports from Bethlehem, Hebron, Ramallah and East Jerusalem to explore what life is like for young Palestinians in 2016.&#13;
&#13;
'Viva Cuba Libre' - On March 21, President Obama becomes the first sitting American president to visit Cuba in 88 years, advancing the campaign to prove that engagement with longtime adversaries is effective in renewing dialogue and promoting change. VICE visits the 2015 Summit of the Americas to see the political thawing of relationships between Cuba and the United States, and then Havana, Cuba to speak to Cubans about how music and culture are helping bridge the divide between two former enemies.</summary>
