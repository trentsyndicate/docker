  <summary>On the eve of a historic nuclear-weapons summit with a North Korean delegation, Robin Foster, the British Ambassador to Thailand, learns that his daughter Chloe has been kidnapped by a ruthless Bangkok gang led by an expatriate named Ray McQueen. Racing against the clock to locate the girl, Scott, Stonebridge and their Section 20 team – including boss Philip Locke and agents Julia Richmond and Kim Martinez – track the thugs through the canals and streets of Thailand. When their efforts stall, Foster ends up following his own instincts, despite the chance that things could get worse before they get better.</summary>
