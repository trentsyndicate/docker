  <summary>The boys are called away after MI5 team traced Latif to Chechen rebels country hideout, which turns out to be an abandoned vast Soviet area tunnel complex. They go in with support from Georgian commandos, which are eliminated by explosives. Latif escapes with some cahoots, who were screened for surgery. Some turn up in Budapest, where a world security summit is held, carrying the neuro-toxin and sophisticated bomb found in the tunnels. Damien also found indications of foul play since his Iraq set-up army booting. </summary>
