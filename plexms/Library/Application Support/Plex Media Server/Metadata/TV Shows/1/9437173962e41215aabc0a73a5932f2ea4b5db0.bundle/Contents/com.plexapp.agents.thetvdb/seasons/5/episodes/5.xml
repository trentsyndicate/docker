  <summary>Posing as Russian construction workers, Scott and Stonebridge cross the North Korean border in an attempt to blow up a strategic munitions site, but find their route paved with obstacles.  Mission accomplished for now, Mei returns home and reunites with an old flame.  In Bangkok, Finn chats with the wrong stranger, and ends up running for his life.  As North Korean officials celebrate the Yakuza's nuclear bonanza, Lei worries about the dangers ahead - concerns that seem legit when a pair of interlopers arrive to spoil the party.</summary>
