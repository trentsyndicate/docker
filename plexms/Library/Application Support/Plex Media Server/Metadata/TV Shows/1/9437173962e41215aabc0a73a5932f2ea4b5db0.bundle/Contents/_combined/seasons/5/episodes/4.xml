  <summary>Hoping to track down the Yakuza's shipment of vanadium - a metal crucial to the making of nuclear weapons - Scott strikes a deal with Faber and Mason, a pair of bounty hunters looking to kill Shiro.  Having convinced Finn that he's not a drug dealer, Scott sends his son on a bus to safety and heads off to rendezvous with his mates, who've got all they can handle in a firefight at the Kokura Foundation, a legal front for Shiro's drug operation.  As Locke tries to uncover the truth about Shiro and his father, Mei looks to slip out of the crossfire, again.  </summary>
