  <summary>The Macon 7’s unexpected flight from the Macon Plantation is marked with danger at every turn. The already strained dynamic begins to pit every man and woman against the other, while Ernestine, Pearly Mae, Sam and the other slaves left behind face new, strict sanctions of their own. Out in the woods, Cato takes drastic measures to ensure his own safety while simultaneously putting one of the Macon 7 in harm’s way of the slave catchers. August Pullman and his son Ben continue their search for the runaways as John and Elizabeth Hawkes, still recovering from their ordeal with Josey, officially launch their Underground Railroad station stop. Meanwhile, Tom Macon is worried that the Macon 7’s escape will affect Reverend Willowset’s upcoming visit to vet him for his senate campaign. And Pearly Mae receives a life-changing offer that is threatened by Ernestine’s calculated move.</summary>
