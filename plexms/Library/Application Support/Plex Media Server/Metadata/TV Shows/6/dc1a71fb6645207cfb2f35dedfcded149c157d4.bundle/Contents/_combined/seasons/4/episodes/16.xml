  <summary>The Chimpanzee beneficiaries of Sandy's undersea treedome are paying a visit to see what progress she has made with her inventions. But Sandy doesn't think any of her work will satisfy the chimps, and if they don't like what she's invented Sandy could lose her funding forcing her to leave Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick decide to help their distraught friend by taking over her work and finishing her inventions.</summary>
