  <summary>Murtaugh delves deep into the psyche of a former navy seal who is wanted for criminal activity, and draws parallels between him and his partner, Riggs, who also served in the military. Riggs' connection to the suspect threatens to interfere with the case, but it also forces him to open up to Murtaugh.</summary>
