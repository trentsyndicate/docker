  <summary>The whole precinct's holiday celebrations are cut short when they're called to examine a ruthless homicide linked to Eddie Flores (guest star Raul Casso), the deranged nephew of a notable drug lord who has a previous history with Riggs. The holiday season weighs heavily on Riggs, who flashes back to past Christmases with his former wife, Miranda. Murtaugh is also a little preoccupied with his neighbor's obnoxious holiday decorations.</summary>
