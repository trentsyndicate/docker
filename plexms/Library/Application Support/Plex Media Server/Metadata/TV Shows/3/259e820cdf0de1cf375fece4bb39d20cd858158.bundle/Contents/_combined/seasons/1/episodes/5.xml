However, it seems there may be an ulterior motive to her hunt for the murderous synth. Meanwhile, the Hawkins debate whether to keep Anita in light of their recent discovery that she is not quite as `new' as she seemed, and while Joe worries his domestic synth might inadvertently reveal his secret, Mattie's decision to place her trust in Leo could put an end to the family's arguments.</summary>
