  <summary>With the Synths now in captivity, Hobb attempts to extract Elsterâ€™s consciousness programming from their brains. There ends up being one final piece of the puzzle missing that nobody, including Leo could ever have imagined though. The devastated Hawkins family come to realise much Mia mean to them and their courage is put to the test as they take on Hobb and his forces in an effort to save the Synths from their imprisonment.</summary>
