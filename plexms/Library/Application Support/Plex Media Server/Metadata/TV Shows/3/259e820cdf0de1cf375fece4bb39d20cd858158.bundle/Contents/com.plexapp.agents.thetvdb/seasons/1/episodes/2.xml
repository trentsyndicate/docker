  <summary>Laura is suspicious of Anita, and feels threatened by her presence. Hobb holds Fred prisoner in his facility, but while Hobb's superiors marvel at this unique specimen, Fred voices his fears about what this means to humanity. After a violent incident, Niska escapes her brothel prison, pursued by Karen and Pete. Leo's quest for information takes him to increasingly dangerous places. George's worst fears are realised when the health service give him a new Synth, Vera, who he immediately despises.</summary>
