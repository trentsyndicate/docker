  <summary>Laura finds herself at odds with her family when she tries to return Anita to the shop, but Laura is begrudgingly forced to keep her when Anita saves Toby from a near-fatal road accident. Joe suggests that Laura is imagining Anita's strange behaviour, but he can't help noticing how human Anita appears when he has to check her for damage. George seems to have submitted to Vera's joyless routine, but he is actually hatching a daring plan to escape with Odi. Pete and Karen investigate a murder at a brothel, but after Pete's hot temper earns him a suspension, he finds himself stuck at home with Simon.</summary>
