  <summary>Jonas and his team must track down surface-to-air missles before they are smuggled out of Brazil after a deal with a drug lord falls through. Jonas gets help from a local boy who informs the team where the SAMs have been taken to be shipped. Meanwhile back on the base, Kim ends up causing even more trouble when she insists that the “Family Readiness Group” deals with what she deems more serious issues. Also, Williams tries to find a way to tell the woman he wants to marry that he is actually a Unit member and not a clerk on the base like she believes.&#13;
