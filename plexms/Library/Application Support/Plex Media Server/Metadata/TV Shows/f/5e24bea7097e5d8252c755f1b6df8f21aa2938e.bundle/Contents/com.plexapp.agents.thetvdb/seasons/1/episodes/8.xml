  <summary>In the climax of the investigation, the head of the team leads a search of two marshes in the heart of Bogota that are listed in the declassified FBI files as being the location of a submerged plane that transported Hitler to the area. Using historical maps and cutting edge technology the team corroborates information from the FBI file and finds evidence of a suspicious object buried deep in the mud of a marsh matching the description within the files, which could be a plane!&#13;
