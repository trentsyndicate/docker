  <summary>Big Bird is very excited because his pen pal, Penelope Penguin, is visiting Sesame Street. Suddenly, Penelope rushes in and gives Big Bird, Chris, and a customer a great big hug. Penelope just can't help herself; she gets so excited when meeting new friends. Chris explains that it's great to feel enthusiastic, but next time maybe she can give a ‘Penguin pound' with her flipper instead. &#13;
&#13;
Big Bird introduces Penelope to his friends Elmo, Rosita, and Telly, who are playing basketball. Just as she's about to run over to give them a hug, Chris stops her and she remembers to give them ‘Penguin pounds'. They invite Penelope to play, but instead of passing she hogs the ball and scores. She thought if she scored everyone would want to be her friend, however the group is upset that she didn't share the ball. Chris then suggests a strategy to help Penelope, to stop and think about how others would feel if she didn't control herself. She gives the strategy a try and it works. Penelope becomes a team player and passes the ball to Rosita. &#13;
&#13;
To celebrate, Chris gives everyone ice cream. Penelope thinks something is missing and places fish on everyone's ice cream without asking. In her enthusiasm, she then eats everyone's ice cream. Penelope doesn't understand why she can't control herself and tells Chris that she has a hard time making friends. Chris reassures her that she can make friends; she just needs to remember to stop and think. Will Penelope remember to use this strategy to make friends?</summary>
