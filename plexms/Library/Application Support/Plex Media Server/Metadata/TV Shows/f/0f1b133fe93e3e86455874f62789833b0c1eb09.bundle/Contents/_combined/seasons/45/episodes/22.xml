  <summary>Elmo is going to the movies for the first time with Chris and his new friend, Jack B. Nimble, who loves to jump. Leela helps Elmo practice sitting in his seat and paying attention. He needs to watch with his eyes, listen with his hears, and sit on his bottom when he's at the movie. &#13;
&#13;
When Chris, Elmo, and Jack get to the movie theater Jacks jumps into a seat. The usher walks over and explains that there's no jumping in the movie theater, so if he wants to watch the movie he needs to pay attention and sit in his seat. Jack gets worried because he doesn't think he'll be able to sit down for the entire movie. Elmo has a strategy that could help. He tells Jack to watch with his eyes, listen with his ears, and sit on his bottom. Jack tries but can't resist jumping, so Chris gives him another strategy to use â€“ imagining that there is a big stop sign telling him to stop. Jack tries, but he just can't resist. The usher comes over and explains that if he can't control himself, he'll need to leave. &#13;
&#13;
Elmo doesn't want Jack to leave and Jack doesn't want to leave either, but he comes from a jumping nursery rhyme and it's hard for him to sit down for so long. Elmo thinks it's too bad Jack doesn't come from a sitting down nursery rhyme. From that Jack gets an idea and creates a new rhyme so that he sits in his seat. Chris then encourages Jack to repeat the new rhyme whenever he feels like jumping again. Jack keeps repeating the new rhyme to himself and it works. He is able to sit down for the rest of the movie. The usher is so happy that he jumps into a guest's arms. Jack reminds him that there is no jumping in the movie theater and explains that he has a strategy that might help.</summary>
