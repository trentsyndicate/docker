  <summary>There is an awful smell and noise coming from Oscar's trashcan, so Chris walks over and asks Oscar about it. It's a P.U.gelhorn, a grouch instrument, and they're selling it on Scramazon for only eight bags of trash. Oscar would like to get one so he and Fluffy can play a duet. Including the two bags of trash from Chris, Oscar would just need three more bags to purchase the instrument. &#13;
&#13;
Mucklemore walks by, and Oscar asks where he found his fish hat. He explains that he purchased it at the grouch thrift shop and invites Oscar to come with him, but Chris tells Oscar to stop and think and reminds him that he needs to save his trash. So Mucklemore offers to give his hat to Oscar for the bargain price of five bags of trash. Oscar agrees and gives him all of his trash bags leaving him with zero. When Oscar sees something he wants, he's gotta have it. &#13;
&#13;
Goozie Orman, a grouch who has more trash than any grouch in the world, pops in and gives Oscar a strategy to use. When he sees something he wants, he should pretend it's something he can't stand, something nice or cute. Oscar gets a Scramazon alert for the new Sty-phone six and is very tempted to buy it. Goozie explains that he doesn't have enough trash to buy both the phone and instrument and that he needs to choose. Oscar thinks about it and remembers that he promised Fluffy he would get the P.U.gelhorn. Will Oscar be able to control his impulses and save enough trash for the P.U.gelhorn?</summary>
