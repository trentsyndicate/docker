  <summary>Chris is on his way to work when he runs into Elmo. He asks Elmo if he would be interested in going to park and ride the merry-go-round after work. But Elmo just says, "no." Elmo explains that he feels a bit cranky, grumpy, and grouchy. Oscar pops in and knows exactly what's happening; Elmo is turning into a grouch. Chris doesn't believe Oscar and assures Elmo that he's not turning into a grouch before heading off to work.&#13;
&#13;
When he's gone, Oscar suggests that if Elmo wants to know if he's a grouch he can take the Grouch Test. First, Elmo needs to do the opposite of what Oscar tells him to do, and, for the second part, Elmo needs to look at a close-up picture and guess what it is. Elmo passes both parts and in honor of being a grouch, Oscar gives Elmo his own trashcan to live in. &#13;
&#13;
When Chris finishes work and comes back to pick up Elmo, Elmo tells him that he passed the second part of the test and is definitely a grouch. Because he's a grouch he still doesn't want to ride the merry-go-round. Chris explains that not everyone feels happy all the time. There are different types of feelings and those feelings come and go. If Elmo doesn't like how he's feeling he can change that feeling. If Elmo can change his feelings then maybe he will want to ride the merry-go-round.</summary>
