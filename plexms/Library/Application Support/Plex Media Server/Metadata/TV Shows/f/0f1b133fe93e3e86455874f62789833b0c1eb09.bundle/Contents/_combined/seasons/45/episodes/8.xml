  <summary>Bert is playing Angry Pigeons on his phone. Ernie comes in to ask if he can borrow Bert's phone for his plan â€“ to get the whole world to dance with him. He asks if Bert would like to dance with him, but Bert doesn't want to. Bert dancing was part of his plan, so Ernie isn't sure what he is supposed to do now. Bert suggests that he change the plan. Ernie thinks that's a great idea because if he came up with the plan, he can just change the plan. &#13;
&#13;
Ernie asks for the audience to dance with him. He then asks Bert again if he would like to dance with him now, but Bert still doesn't want to. He explains to Ernie that if he can change the plan once, he can change it again. Ernie agrees and also asks Mando, Big Bird, Chris, Alan, and Snuffy to dance along with him. They all join in and even add in some of their own moves, creating a new dance. &#13;
&#13;
Between dances, Ernie continues to ask Bert join, but Bert doesn't want to dance, he just wants his phone back. When the video is complete, Ernie's last step in his plan is to put the video on the internet for the whole world to see. Hopefully Ernie's video goes viral.</summary>
