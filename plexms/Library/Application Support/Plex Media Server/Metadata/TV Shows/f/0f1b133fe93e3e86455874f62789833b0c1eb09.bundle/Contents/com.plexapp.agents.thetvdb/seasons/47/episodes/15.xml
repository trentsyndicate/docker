  <summary>Big Bird finds Elmo and Abby playing with Julia, a new friend on Sesame Street. Big Bird notices that Julia plays a little bit differently than the others and Alan helps him understand that Julia has autism. Big Bird learns that kids with autism sometimes do things in a different way, but they share many things in common with all kids — like wanting to have fun and be loved. Julia and the Sesame friends invent a new game called “boing tag,” and then all come together to dance and sing, celebrating the amazing in all kids.</summary>
