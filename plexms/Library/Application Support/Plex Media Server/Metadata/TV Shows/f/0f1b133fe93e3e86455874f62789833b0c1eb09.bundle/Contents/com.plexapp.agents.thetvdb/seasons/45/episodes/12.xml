  <summary>Big Bird is spending time reading to his teddy bear Radar. Suddenly, Radar falls out of his nest. Big Bird quickly leaves to get Radar and when he comes back, another bird is sitting in his nest. Her name is Minnie Mynah and she says that Big Bird left his nest empty, so the nest is now hers. She says the bird rule is finders keepers, losers weepers. Big Bird suggests that they share the nest, but Minnie doesn't want to share. &#13;
&#13;
Big Bird finds another nest but it belongs to another bird. He knows how it feels to have another bird take your nest, so he gives it back. Chris comes over and suggests that Big Bird ask for his nest back. On Sesame Street there are different rules: you don't take things that don't belong to you. Chris tries to reason with Minnie, but she still says that the nest is hers because of the bird rule. Chris decides to speak to the Supreme Bird Court who made up the bird rule. &#13;
&#13;
The Court listens to both sides of the story and they make their decision: the rule clearly states finders keepers losers weepers, so the nest now belongs to Minnie. Chris tells Big Bird that he needs to speak up, so Big Bird asks the Court how they would feel if they lived in a nest and another bird took it away. The Court realizes that they would feel sad and angry too. Minnie also understands but will that be enough to change her mind about Big Bird's nest?</summary>
