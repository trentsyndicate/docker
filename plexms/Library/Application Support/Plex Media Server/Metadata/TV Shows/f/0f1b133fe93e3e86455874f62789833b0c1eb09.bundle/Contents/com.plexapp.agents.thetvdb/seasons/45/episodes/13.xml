  <summary>Elmo made a present for Rosita just because she is a really good friend. Rosita thanks Elmo and as she is about to open the present Elmo's mother calls him for lunch. Elmo asks Rosita not to open the present until he gets back. Rosita says that she will wait but tells Elmo to hurry up because she is very excited. &#13;
&#13;
After Elmo leaves, Leela and Alan explain that Rosita needs to try to resist and control herself from opening the present. They come up with a strategy of sitting on her hands and tell her to repeat to herself "I'm sitting on my hands so I cannot open my present." But it only works for a short time. Abby then pops in and says she knows of another strategy to help Rosita – a dancing spell. But Abby's spell accidentally makes Alan and Leela dance. Panicked, they ask Abby to quickly say another spell so Rosita doesn't open her present. Abby magically freezes everyone, but they can't stay like that forever. &#13;
&#13;
Abby thinks of another strategy her mother taught her – to imagine that the present is something else. Leela and Alan suggest imagining it as something she wouldn't want to touch like a porcupine or a block of ice. That strategy works for a while but Rosita still can't resist. Will Rosita be able to control herself?</summary>
