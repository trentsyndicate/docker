  <summary>Telly tells his friends Mando, Elmo, Abby, and Rosita all about a website called AreYouCool.Cool. It tells you what is trending, which means what's super cool. Mando checks out the website on his laptop and it says that the latest trend is wearing a big cowboy hat. Telly, Elmo, and Rosita run off and quickly come back wearing their big hats. But the trend quickly changes to wearing bigger hats and then again to wearing the biggest hats. Mando isn't sure about wearing the biggest hats because they look heavy. Abby, however, likes wearing opera hats and pretending to be in an opera. She starts to sing and Rosita mentions how much fun Abby is having with her hat, but Telly explains that only cowboy hats are cool according to the website. &#13;
&#13;
The trend changes and it's now cool to wear two sunglasses at the same time, which quickly changes to wearing three sunglasses. Mando doesn't think this is a good choice either because it doesn't seem like they can see anything through that many glasses. Abby has her own kind of glasses she likes to wear and they make her laugh every time she looks in the mirror. Mando then breaks the news that the sunglasses just became un-cool. &#13;
&#13;
Rosita asks how they're supposed to know what is cool if it keeps changing. Telly explains that is why they need the website, to know what they should like next. But they don't even like the music that is considered cool. Instead, Abby sings her favorite kind of music, a sea shanty. Mando explains to Telly, Elmo, and Rosita that Abby doesn't need to follow what other people do; she likes to be original. Perhaps they all should just do the things that make them happy. </summary>
