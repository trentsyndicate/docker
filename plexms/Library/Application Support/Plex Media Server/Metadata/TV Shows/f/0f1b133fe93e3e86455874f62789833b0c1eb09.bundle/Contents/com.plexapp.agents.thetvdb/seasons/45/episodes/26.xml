  <summary>Telly is ready to have a magical play date with Abby, but she doesn't have her wand because it is being cleaned. Abby explains that instead they can search for magic on Sesame Street using majoggles – holding their hands up to their eyes like goggles so they can focus on the magic. They see Leela outside of the laundromat using tape to take the fur off of a customer's coat. Abby thinks this is magic but Leela explains that the tape is not magic – it's just a tool that can help you do all sorts of things. Telly thinks it's cool too, but it's not magic, so they go off trying to find real magic. &#13;
&#13;
As they walk around, they see Gordon chasing his papers that flew on the ground. Gordon gathers his papers and uses a stapler to staple them together. Abby again thinks this is magic, but Gordon explains that the stapler is just a tool he uses so the papers won't blow away. Telly becomes upset because they only found another tool, no magic. &#13;
&#13;
He walks away and accidentally bumps into Luis who drops his plate of nuts and bolts. Abby runs in as Telly apologizes, but Luis reassures him and says that he has the perfect tool to pick them up. He uses a magnet to attract the metal nuts and bolts, allowing him to pick up more than one at a time. Telly thinks this is the coolest tool he's ever seen. Just then, the fairy cleaner pops in to give Abby's wand back. She and Telly can now do some real magic, but Telly is too intrigued by the magnet.</summary>
