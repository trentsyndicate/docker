  <summary>Elmo is helping Leela fold clothes at the Laundromat when Oscar comes in ready to pick up his wet grimed tuxedo. Leela returns with a cleaned tux and explains that there was a mix-up with someone else's clothes. Elmo and Leela feel terrible and ask Oscar how he got the stains on his tuxedo. The first stain was of a triangle-slice of mud pie from Oscar's high school Grouch dance, the second stain was a pattern of rotten tomatoes and rotten eggs from when he was a stand-up comedian, and the third stain was of three onions rings with anchovy sauce that were big, bigger, and biggest from his grouch wedding. &#13;
&#13;
Elmo remembers each stain, so to make it up to Oscar, Elmo and Leela recreate the stains with help from Chris. For the first stain, Chris cuts a square mud-pie into two halves so that they have their triangle-shaped mud pie slice. For the second stain, Elmo gives Chris the pattern he needs to throw the rotten tomatoes and rotten eggs. For the third stain, they make sure that there are big, bigger, and biggest onion rings. &#13;
&#13;
Chris, Elmo, and Leela walk over to Oscar's trashcan and surprise him with the newly stained tuxedo. Just as Leela is about to hand it to Oscar, she accidentally drops it and Bert rides over on his bike, making a tire stain on the tux. Oscar is so happy because now he has a new, fresh stain on his tuxedo.</summary>
