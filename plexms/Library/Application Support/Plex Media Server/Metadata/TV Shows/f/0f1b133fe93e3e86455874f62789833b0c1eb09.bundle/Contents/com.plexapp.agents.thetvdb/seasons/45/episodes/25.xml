  <summary>Grover is trying to find something fun to do on Sesame Street today. He first helps Alan whisk blueberries into the pancake batter, but then he hears Chris and Leela playing basketball. He quickly runs over, with whisk and bowl in hand, and asks to play with them. As he mixes and dribbles, Grover overhears Big Bird practicing the trumpet with Bob. Grover asks if he could play the trumpet, too. Bob explains that playing the trumpet takes a lot of practice, but Grover says he has already mastered cooking and playing basketball so now he will master playing the trumpet. &#13;
&#13;
He tries to play, but no sound comes out of the trumpet. As Grover continues trying, he sees Abby and Elmo learning a new dance with Zoe. He asks if he can dance, too. Grover is now trying to play basketball, whisk the pancake batter, play the trumpet, and dance all at the same time. Everyone asks Grover if it would be easier for him to focus on one thing at a time, but he doesn't know why he would do just one thing if he can do all of these things so well. &#13;
&#13;
He then sees Mando painting and he wants to do that too. Mando sets him up with a paintbrush and easel. As Grover tries to do everything all at once, he falls. He just can't do it all. He starts to think that he's not good at anything. Mando explains Grover fell because he was doing too many things at the same time. He suggests that when Grover gets distracted he should slow down, breathe, and focus on one thing at a time. If Grover takes Mando's advice may he might be able to succeed.</summary>
