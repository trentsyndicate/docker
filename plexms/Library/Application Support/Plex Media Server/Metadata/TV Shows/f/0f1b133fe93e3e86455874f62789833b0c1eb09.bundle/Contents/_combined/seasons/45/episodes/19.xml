  <summary>Telly is helping Alan out at Hooper's Store, and he just prepared today's special signature sandwich. Suddenly, the old woman who lives in a shoe drives up to the window and asks if they can make lunch for her children. Alan and Telly need to know how many sandwiches to make, but the children are all moving around. Telly comes up with the idea of playing the game Freeze Dance to keep the children from moving. &#13;
&#13;
Once the music stops the children freeze and Telly counts seven of them. The old woman explains that she has more than seven children and calls the girls into the store. As the old woman steps out, Alan and Telly use Freeze Dance to count the girls and add them to the boys that they already counted. They count twelve children all together, so Alan and Telly start to make one sandwich for each child. They each say their name and step up to the counter in front of one of the sandwiches. &#13;
&#13;
When the old woman returns, she asks if Alan and Telly can watch the children a little while longer and give them something to drink. Alan and Telly use freeze dance again and divide the children into three different groups depending on what flavor smoothie they want, banana, strawberry or peach. As the children finish their smoothies, the old woman returns. She and the children thank Alan and Telly for their help and delicious food, and she mentions that she'll be back again to try the signature sandwich herself.</summary>
