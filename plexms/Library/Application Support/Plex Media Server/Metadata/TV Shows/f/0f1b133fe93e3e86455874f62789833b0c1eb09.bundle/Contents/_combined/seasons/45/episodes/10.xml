  <summary>While Elmo is going for a ride by Hooper's Store on his tricycle he sees Chris. He asks if Chris wants to go for a ride, but Chris need to work. As Elmo leaves, he notices Chris' new bicycle horn. Elmo wishes he had a horn just like that. Just then, Guy Smiley pops in and asks if Elmo is ready to play on the show â€˜Calm Down and Think.' Guy explains to Elmo that if he can calm down and think and answer three questions correctly, he will win a brand new bicycle horn just like Chris'. Elmo is ready to play. &#13;
&#13;
Guy explains that he first needs to pick a coach who will train him to calm down and think. Elmo sees Alan and chooses him to be his coach. Alan agrees and it's time for the first question. Elmo is very excited he doesn't know how he's going to answer the question so Alan suggests that he hug himself to help him calm down and think. Elmo feels much better and is able to answer correctly. It's now time for the second question and Elmo becomes excited again. Alan explains that he needs to calm down so he can focus so Elmo tries hugging himself again but it doesn't work. &#13;
&#13;
Alan then suggests that Elmo use a different strategy, to take a deep breath and use focus binoculars. Elmo tries the new strategy and gives the right answer. Just then, Alan's phone rings. He needs to help Chris at the store but he says he'll be right back. Guy moves on to the third and last question. Elmo needs Alan's help to calm down and think, but then he remembers the strategies he used. Will he be able to incorporate the strategies without Alan's help?</summary>
