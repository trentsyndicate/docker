  <summary>It's Pickled Pepper Day at Hooper's Store, a day when all of the specials start with the letter P and are made with pickled peppers. Alan ordered his peppers from Peter Piper, but when Peter Piper shows up he doesn't have them. Peter Piper wants to do something with more pizzazz and it has to start with the letter P. Peter goes off to try to find something else to pizazzier do, so Telly agrees to help pick the peppers instead. &#13;
&#13;
Alan gives him a picture of a pickled pepper so he can find the right one in the pepper patch. There are three customers in the store and Telly needs to pick a pepper for each customer. Telly finds the right peppers and starts to run back but accidentally runs into Peter pogoing with a pair of penguins and drops the peppers. Peter realizes that pogoing is still not pizzazzy enough so he goes off again to try to something else. &#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, more customers enter the store and there are now six customers who need peppers. Telly sets out to pick peppers again, but when he returns, he runs into Peter pirouetting with a perky pachyderm and drops the peppers. Peter finds pirouetting not pizzazzy enough either. The crowd at Hooper's keeps growing and they are now in need of a peck of pickled peppers- that's a lot of peppers. Peter Piper is the only person who can pick that many peppers but will he stop his pursuit of something pizzazier to help?</summary>
