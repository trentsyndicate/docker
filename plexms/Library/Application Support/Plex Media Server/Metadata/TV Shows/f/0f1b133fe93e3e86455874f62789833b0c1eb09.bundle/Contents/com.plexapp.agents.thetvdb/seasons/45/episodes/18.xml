  <summary>Everyone is getting ready to celebrate Friendship Day on Sesame Street! Elmo and Zoe are practicing a dance they want to perform. Zoe shows Elmo the steps a couple of times but he falls trying to do the last step. Zoe shows him one more time, but Elmo still can't do it. Zoe becomes frustrated and says that he is the worst. Zoe takes a couple of deep breaths to calm down and tells Elmo to try it again, but Elmo is no longer there. She finds him, but he's upset and doesn't want to dance with Zoe anymore.&#13;
&#13;
As Elmo leaves, Abby comes by and Zoe explains that Elmo is upset with her, but she doesn't know why. Abby uses her memory spell so they can replay what happened. Abby points out that when Zoe called Elmo the worst it hurt his feelings. Zoe says that she just got frustrated and said it; it didn't mean anything. She finds Elmo and tries to explain that she didn't mean â€˜the worst.' Elmo then tells Zoe that it was a word he didn't like, and it hurt his feelings. &#13;
&#13;
As he walks away, Leela and Chris explain to Zoe that words can really hurt, especially when you say something mean to somebody. She needs to be careful with the words she says. Zoe didn't know that a little word can hurt so much and now understands. She apologizes to Elmo, saying that she would never want to lose him as a friend. Elmo forgives Zoe and they get ready for their Friendship Day dance. They go through the steps and Elmo falls again, but rather than getting frustrated, Zoe encourages Elmo to not give up. Now that Zoe is more encouraging Elmo is sure to get the last step.</summary>
