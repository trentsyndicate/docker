  <summary>Big Bird and Alan's favorite writer, Mother Goose, is visiting Sesame Street, and she brought some of her nursery rhyme creations to perform. Their first guest is Little Miss Muffet, but every time she sees "the tuffet" she feels anxious because she knows a spider will appear. Alan gives her a strategy to help her feel better â€“ belly breathing. Miss Muffet takes a slow deep breathe in through her nose and out through her mouth but she still feels a little anxious. &#13;
&#13;
Big Bird then asks Mother Goose if she can make up a new rhyme for Miss Muffet so she doesn't have to feel anxious. Mother Goose is not sure if she'll be able to do it but, with Alan's encouragement, she makes up a new rhyme. Miss Muffet and the spider now play tag, and Miss Muffet no longer feels anxious. &#13;
&#13;
Mother Goose has one more guest to bring out, Little Jack Horner. He recites his rhyme, but every time he sticks his thumb in the pie he's disappointed that it's a plum again. Alan also gives Jack a belly breathing strategy, and Big Bird thinks a new rhyme would help solve this problem too. Mother Goose is not sure but, with a little more encouragement, she is able to make up a new rhyme. Instead of pulling out a plum, Little Jack Horner pulls out delicious guacamole instead. Mother Goose feels excited every time she writes a new rhyme. In fact, she is so excited that she writes a new rhyme about Alan and Big Bird, her two helpful friends.</summary>
