  <summary>Papa Bear is a parent volunteer at Baby Bear's school today. He greets Baby Bear's teacher, Ms. Goodwitch, with a bear hug because that's how they say hello at home. Baby Bear explains that they only say "good morning" to one another at preschool; they don't give bear hugs. &#13;
&#13;
At preschool, Papa Bear also learns that even if you know the answer you raise your hand and wait for Ms. Goodwitch to call on you, if you want the same crayon as your classmate, you don't growl, you take turns, and you cannot eat everyone's snacks like you're scavenging for food in the woods. Baby Bear explains that school is different from home, and there are things he does at home that he doesn't do at school. Papa Bear apologizes. &#13;
&#13;
Papa Bear doesn't want to embarrass Baby Bear anymore so he begins to leave, but Baby Bear is not embarrassed and Ms. Goodwitch explains that when Baby Bear first started preschool, he had to learn the school rules too. She then says that she needs help at story time and asks if Papa Bear would like to read the story of the three bears. Who better to read it than their parent volunteer, Papa Bear.</summary>
