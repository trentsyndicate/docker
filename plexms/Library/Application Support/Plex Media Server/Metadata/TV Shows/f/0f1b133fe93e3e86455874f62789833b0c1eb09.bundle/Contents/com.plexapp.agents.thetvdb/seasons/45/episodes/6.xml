  <summary>Maria and Luis are looking at pictures from Maria's quinceañera when Zoe and Abby walk over. Maria explains that a quinceañera is a party that some Latinas have when they turn fifteen. Just then, the number fifteen walks in and says that she's never had a quinceañera so Abby and Zoe plan to give her a quinceañera party. The number fifteen thanks them and only asks that there is fifteen of everything at the party. &#13;
&#13;
With help from Mando, Abby and Zoe first start with party decorations. They find fifteen balloons, fifteen streamers, and fifteen jewels for the throne. Next, Abby and Zoe look for some food. They find fifteen tamalitos and fifteen empanadas, but the number fifteen says that would make thirty things to eat all together, not fifteen. Mando helps Abby and Zoe solve the problem by compromising. They add some of the tamalitos with some of the empanadas to make fifteen all together. &#13;
&#13;
The last thing for the party is fifteen dancers. Abby and Zoe find all the dancers they can, but there are only fourteen. Abby and Zoe both want to dance but that will be one dancer too many. Mando helps Abby and Zoe again by helping them come up with a compromise. They realize that they can both be dancers by taking turns. They now have everything for the quinceañera so the party begins.</summary>
