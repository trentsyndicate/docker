  <summary>As Rintarō decides to resume his experiments, Moeka requests to send a D-Mail. As she sends the D-Mail, Rintarō is shifted onto a new timeline where Moeka never came to the lab. The next day, Ruka comes to the lab, asking to send a D-Mail to the past so that he would be born as a girl. They send a D-Mail to Ruka's mother's pager from before he was born, letting her know of an urban legend about how mothers-to-be can affect their baby's gender by eating certain foods. Rintarō moves to a new world line, though he doesn't notice anything particularly different at first. </summary>
