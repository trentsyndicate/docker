  <summary>Despite the change in divergence, Mayuri's death still takes place, albeit a day later than in previous timelines. Rintarō asks for Kurisu's help, who theorises that, since negating Rintarō's D-Mail about Suzuha delayed the attack, undoing the effects of the other D-Mails could bring them back to a World Line where they have an IBN-5100, letting them hack into SERN and delete the records that set them on Rintarō's trail. Rintarō starts by trying to figure out how to reverse Rumiho's D-Mail, while helping her evade a rival gaming gang. Rintarō takes Rumiho to the place where her maid cafe used to be and tells her about the way Akihabara was. Rumiho comes to remember the previous timeline and the D-Mail she sent: a fake ransom note, which prevented her father from boarding a plane fated to crash. The rival gang catches up to them but they are rescued by the arrival of Rumiho's father. Speaking to him, Rintarō learns that Suzuha gave him the IBN-5100, but he was forced to sell it in order to pay for the fake kidnapping's ransom. After accepting the reality of her father's death, Rumiho agrees to send a D-Mail cancelling out her previous one, turning Akihabara back into a moe hub. The IBN-5100, however, still remains out of reach.</summary>
