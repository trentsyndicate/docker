After getting some provisions from crossdresser Ruka Urushibara and meeting Suzuha Amane, who gets hired to work part time in the electronic's shop below his apartment, Rintarō investigates the supposedly altered events and learns of a man calling himself John Titor who claims to be a time traveller.
