  <summary>After some improvements are made to the Mobile Microwave, Rintarō decides to experiment changing the past by sending winning lottery numbers to the past. After sending the text, the past is changed to where Ruka has bought a lottery ticket, but Rintarō didn't perform the experiment, with only Rintarō retaining the memory of what had happened, realising time has been put onto a new timeline. Confused as to why only he can remember the previous timeline, Rintarō contacts John Titor, who tells him he may have the power to become a messiah and change the future. </summary>
