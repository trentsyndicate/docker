  <summary>Easy Company carries out a dangerous mission in Haguenau as David Webster  returns from a hospital. Together with new replacement 2nd Lt. Jones, he eventually (re)integrates with the other soldiers, whose experiences at Bastogne have made them weary and closed off from Webster due to the fact he didn't try and leave hospital early unlike other soldiers in the company. </summary>
