  <summary>With Tony in custody, Jack leads his interrogation, but is shocked when a code word Tony whispers in his ear leads to old friends and a plot much deeper than anyone in the FBI anticipated. Jack once again takes the law into his own hands when he breaks Tony out of the FBI's custody to deliver him back to the terrorist faction. Renee asks FBI technician Janis Gold to try to uncover a possible leak in the agency, but Janis is terrified when her discoveries point to fellow analyst Sean Hillinger. Colonel Dubaku sends a message to President Taylor, insisting that the US withdraw its forces from Sangala or risk a terrible attack on their soil.</summary>
