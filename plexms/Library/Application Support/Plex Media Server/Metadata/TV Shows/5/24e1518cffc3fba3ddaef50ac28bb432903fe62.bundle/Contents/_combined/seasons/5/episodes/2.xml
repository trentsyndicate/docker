  <summary>Jack and Chloe infiltrate Wayne Palmer's penthouse where David Palmer was assassinated, in the hopes of finding a clue to his murder. Jack convinces Wayne to cooperate and finds some information in Palmer's memoirs that leads him to the airport where the Russian president is about to land. &#13;
&#13;
CTU and Secret Service attempt to capture Jack, but they only find Chloe as Jack and Derek slip through their grasp. &#13;
&#13;
Martha tries to convince her husband that she received an important phone call from Palmer the night before his death, but a tape of their conversation seems to contradict her claims. &#13;
&#13;
Jack goes to the airport to find a lead, but a group of renegade Russian terrorists take hostages, including Derek, before he can act.&#13;
