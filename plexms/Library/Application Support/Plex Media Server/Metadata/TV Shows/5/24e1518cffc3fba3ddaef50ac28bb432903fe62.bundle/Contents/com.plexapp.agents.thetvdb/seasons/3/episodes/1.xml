  <summary>Three years have passed since the events of Day Two. A van deposits a dead body outside the LA Health Unit. The body is infected with a deadly virus. Tony, now in charge of CTU, learns that this is a blackmail tactic to get the US government to release a drug lord, Ramon Salazar, whom Jack has just brought down, before Salazar's brother releases the virus into LA.&#13;
&#13;
Jack and his new partner, Chase Edmunds, prepare to sign a deal with Salazar at the prison.  Salazar delivers a mysterious warning to Jack before killing his lawyer.&#13;
&#13;
Palmer is alive and well, and has returned to LA for the first time since the attack three years ago. He is running for re-election and is preparing for an important debate with a rival senator. He is accompanied by his brother, who happens to be his chief of staff and his doctor, who also happens to be his girlfriend.&#13;
&#13;
A young boy, Kyle Singer, is seen examining a large, mysterious bag of white powder.  He plans to deliver it to some dealers later that day, but he is being watched by Salazar's men.&#13;
&#13;
Kim now works at CTU and has been dating Chase for three months. Kim wants to tell her father, but Jack has a mysterious health problem that may make things more complicated.&#13;
