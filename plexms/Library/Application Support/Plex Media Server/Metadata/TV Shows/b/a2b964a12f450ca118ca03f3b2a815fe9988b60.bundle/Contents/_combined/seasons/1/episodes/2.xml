  <summary>Lawrence and Holo are now travelling together but it is cut short when they have to seek refuge, from the rain, in a nearby Church. There Lawrence discusses various trade issues with a man and following this a young man named Zheren approaches him. He offers Kraft some information to do with the trade of coins but this could be false information. Once the weather returns to its pleasantness, Lawrence and Holo head off but they end up discussing some distressing topics.</summary>
