  <summary>Pritchard and Duval continue to investigate who Albert Lin really is, who created him and try to uncover how he is involved in a string of murders. The investigation drives a wedge between Mary and Otto, and Otto must choose if he will betray Mary and undo everything they have built, including Pritchard to align himself with Connor Graff. Meanwhile, Gracie goes missing and Pritchard and Duval must race against the clock to rescue her before Pritchardâ€™s time runs out.</summary>
