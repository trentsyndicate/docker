  <summary>Mary’s life is in danger when a dead pool predicts her death for the same day as an important Lookinglass product launch. When Pritchard is needed the most, he fails to show up and winds up in the hospital after a near fatal brawl. After Pritchard's hospitalization, Otto begins to find glitches in Pritchard’s code that might not only drastically change Pritchard, but Mary as well.</summary>
